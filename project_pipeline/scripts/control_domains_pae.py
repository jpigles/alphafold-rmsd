'''
This script calculates the mean predicted aligned error for the subset of proteins labeled as "single domain" by
SCOP-e on the PDB that have only one domain annotated on UniProt and the subset of proteins labeled as "multi domain" by
SCOP-e on the PDB that have two domains annotated on Uniprot. 
See autoinhibition_protein_data/single_domain.ipynb for how these proteins were retrieved.
