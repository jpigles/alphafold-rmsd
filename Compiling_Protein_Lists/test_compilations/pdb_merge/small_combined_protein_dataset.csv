Its autoinhibition is mediated by an intramolecular interaction between beta-sheet (beta1' and beta2') and DFG helix in A-loop. ALK releases autoinhibited conformation by packing N-terminal ?-sheet the C-terminal end of the ?C helix. It is suggested that two phosphorylated tyrosines (Tyr1096 and Tyr1278) prevents ALKs from returning to their positions in the autoinhibited conformation.,Inferred by structure analysis without experimental evidences,,
