The regions C1 (956-1274) and C2 (1276-1657) of IQGAP1 can either interact with nucleotide-free Cdc42, or interact together, depending on the phosphorylation state of Ser-1443. When Ser-1443 is not phosphorylated, C1 and C2 interact, which prevents binding of nucleotide-free Cdc42 and promotes binding of GTP-bound Cdc42. The phosphorylation of Ser-1443 prevents interaction between C1 and C2, which opens the structure of the C-terminus and allows binding and sequestration of nucleotide-free Cdc42 on both C1 and C2.

When the phosphate level is low, LapD is held in the “off” state by interactions of their EAL domain (LapD 399-648), with the S helix (LapD 171-238) and the GGDEF domain (LapD 238-399), which allows the proteolytic reaction of LapA on the cell surface, and consequently biofilm dispersal. Interaction of c-d-GMP to the phosphodiesterase binding site on the EAL domain is required to stimulate the receptor (LapD) by release the S helix and the GGDEF domain facilitating the formation of a trans-subunit dimer interface, the binding of LapG to LapD’s output domain, and consequently permitting the activation of LapA to form biofilm.
