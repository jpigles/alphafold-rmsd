Its autoinhibition is mediated by an intramolecular interaction between beta-sheet (beta1' and beta2') and DFG helix in A-loop.

IQGAP1 binds directly nucleotide-depleted Cdc42 (Cdc42-ND) and may serve as a negative effector or sequester nucleotide-free Cdc42 to prevent signaling. The regions C1 (956-1274) and C2 (1276-1657) of IQGAP1 can either interact with nucleotide-free Cdc42, or interact together, depending on the phosphorylation state of Ser-1443. When Ser-1443 is not phosphorylated, C1 and C2 interact, which prevents binding of nucleotide-free Cdc42 and promotes binding of GTP-bound Cdc42. The phosphorylation of Ser-1443 prevents interaction between C1 and C2, which opens the structure of the C-terminus and allows binding and sequestration of nucleotide-free Cdc42 on both C1 and C2.

Oligomeric Apaf-1 mediates the cytochrome c-dependent autocatalytic activation of pro-caspase- 9 (Apaf-3), leading to the activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. The monomeric form is autoinhibited in a closed conformation through a bound ADP at the nucleotide binding site. The CARD domain of Apaf-1 stacks closely against the ?/? fold and the winged-helix domain. And consequently Apaf-1 exists in a conformation that is incompatible for the recruitment of the CARD domain of caspase-9. The activation of Apaf-1 requires cytochrome c and ATP or dATP.

In mouse Plexin-A3 (P70208), the autoinhibitory regions including an Rho GTPase-binding domain (RBD) and a segment preceding C1 domain make extensive interactions with the GAP domain (C1 and C2 domains), which may enable it to regulate the GAP conformation in response to semaphorin binding.
